# BOM (Browser Object Model)
## Introduction
- The Window object represents the browser window.
- The Window object contains the Document object.
- All global variables, objects, and functions are members of the Window object.
- You can test this with the Document and Console.

## Capabilities of the Window Object
- Open a new window.
- Close the current window.
- Move the current window.
- Resize the current window.
- Print the document.
- Run code after a period of time, either once or repeatedly.
- Fully control the URL.
- Save data inside the browser for later use.

## Example
- Changing the title of the document.
- 

```javascript
window.document.title = "Hello JS";
```

These notes cover the basics of the Browser Object Model (BOM) and provide an example of how to change the title of a document using JavaScript. Remember, the Window object is a fundamental part of working with JavaScript in the browser, and understanding its properties and methods is key to creating interactive web pages.
