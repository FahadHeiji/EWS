In JavaScript, you can track the time taken by an operation using the `Date` object or the `performance.now()` method.

Here’s how you can do it with the `Date` object:

```javascript
let startTime = new Date();

// Perform the operation
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  // Operation...
}

let endTime = new Date();

let timeTaken = endTime - startTime; // Time in milliseconds

console.log(`Time taken: ${timeTaken} ms`);
```

In this example, a `Date` object is created before and after the operation. The difference between the two gives the time taken by the operation in milliseconds.

However, the `Date` object can only provide time with a precision of milliseconds. If you need more precision, you can use the `performance.now()` method, which provides time in microseconds. Here’s how:

```javascript
let startTime = performance.now();

// Perform the operation
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  // Operation...
}

let endTime = performance.now();

let timeTaken = endTime - startTime; // Time in microseconds

console.log(`Time taken: ${timeTaken} µs`);
```

In this example, `performance.now()` is used instead of `new Date()`. The rest of the code is the same.

These methods allow you to measure the time taken by an operation, which can be useful for performance testing and optimization. Note that these measurements can vary slightly each time the code is run, due to factors like CPU load and background tasks. It’s best to run the code multiple times and take an average for more accurate results.
