# Front-End Roadmap

This repository is dedicated to my ongoing journey of learning front-end development. I am using the comprehensive resources provided by [Elzero Web School](https://elzero.org/tracks/front-end/) as my primary guide.


## About This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and share the knowledge I gain as I delve deeper into the world of front-end development. It serves as a personal reference, as well as a resource for other aspiring front-end developers who are on a similar journey.


## What I've Learned So Far

I have already covered HTML and CSS in depth, but I didn't document it. Currently, I am documenting my journey through JavaScript. This is an ongoing process and I will continue to update this repository as I learn more.


## Notes and Assignments

In addition to the concepts and techniques, this repository also includes my notes and assignments. These practical exercises help reinforce what I've learned and give me the opportunity to apply the new skills.


## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore this repository, check out the code, and use it for your own learning. If you find any errors or have suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Compatibility with Obsidian

This repository is compatible with Obsidian, a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files. You can clone this repository and open it in Obsidian to take full advantage of its features.


## Acknowledgements
