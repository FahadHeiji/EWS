## Topic 1: 

Assignment operators in JavaScript are used to assign values to variables. They combine the assignment operation with another operation, such as arithmetic or bitwise operations, allowing you to update the value of a variable in a concise manner.

Here are some examples of assignment operators in JavaScript:

1. **Assignment (`=`):** Assigns the value on the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

   ````javascript
   let x = 10;
   let y = 5;
   ```

   In this example, the value `10` is assigned to the variable `x`, and the value `5` is assigned to the variable `y`.

   ````

1. **Addition Assignment (`+=`):** Adds the value on the right-hand side to the current value of the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.

   ````javascript
   let num = 5;
   num += 3; // Equivalent to: num = num + 3;

   console.log(num); // Output: 8
   ```

   Here, the value of `num` is increased by `3` using the addition assignment operator `+=`.

   ````

1. **Subtraction Assignment (`-=`):** Subtracts the value on the right-hand side from the current value of the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.

   ````javascript
   let num = 10;
   num -= 4; // Equivalent to: num = num - 4;

   console.log(num); // Output: 6
   ```

   In this example, the value of `num` is decreased by `4` using the subtraction assignment operator `-=`.

   ````

1. **Multiplication Assignment (`*=`):** Multiplies the value on the right-hand side with the current value of the variable and assigns the result back to the variable.

   ````javascript
   let num = 3;
   num *= 5; // Equivalent to: num = num * 5;

   console.log(num); // Output: 15
   ```

   Here, the value of `num` is multiplied by `5` using the multiplication assignment operator `*=`.

   ````

1. **Division Assignment (`/=`):** Divides the current value of the variable by the value on the right-hand side and assigns the result back to the variable.

   ````javascript
   let num = 20;
   num /= 4; // Equivalent to: num = num / 4;

   console.log(num); // Output: 5
   ```

   In this example, the value of `num` is divided by `4` using the division assignment operator `/=`.

   ````

These are just a few examples of assignment operators in JavaScript. There are also other assignment operators available, such as remainder assignment (`%=`), exponentiation assignment (`**=`), bitwise operators assignment (`&=`, `|=`, `^=`, etc.), and more.
