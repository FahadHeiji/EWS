## Topic 1: 

Arithmetic operators in JavaScript are used to perform mathematical calculations on numeric values. Here are the commonly used arithmetic operators:

1. **Addition (+):** The addition operator is used to add two or more numbers together or to concatenate strings.

   ````javascript
   let sum = 5 + 3; // Result: 8
   let concatenation = "Hello, " + "world!"; // Result: "Hello, world!"
   ```

   ````

1. **Subtraction (-):** The subtraction operator is used to subtract one number from another.

   ````javascript
   let difference = 10 - 5; // Result: 5
   ```

   ````

1. **Multiplication (\*):** The multiplication operator is used to multiply two numbers.

   ````javascript
   let product = 3 * 4; // Result: 12
   ```

   ````

1. **Division (/):** The division operator is used to divide one number by another.

   ````javascript
   let quotient = 10 / 2; // Result: 5
   ```

   ````

1. **Remainder (%):** The remainder operator, also known as the modulo operator, calculates the remainder of a division operation.

   ````javascript
   let remainder = 10 % 3; // Result: 1 (10 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1)
   ```

   ````

1. **Exponentiation (\*\*):** The exponentiation operator raises the first operand to the power of the second operand.

   ````javascript
   let result = 2 ** 3; // Result: 8 (2 raised to the power of 3)
   ```

   ````

1. **Increment (++) and Decrement (--):** The increment and decrement operators are used to increase or decrease the value of a variable by one.

   ````javascript
   let num = 5;
   num++; // Increment by one (num becomes 6)
   num--; // Decrement by one (num becomes 5 again)
   ```

   ````

When the increment (`++`) or decrement (`--`) operators are placed before the variable, it is called the prefix form. Let's see how they behave in this form:

**Prefix Increment (`++var`):** The prefix increment operator increases the value of the variable by one and returns the new value.

```javascript
let num = 5;
let incrementedNum = ++num;

console.log(incrementedNum); // Output: 6
console.log(num); // Output: 6
```

In this example, `++num` increments the value of `num` by one before the assignment. So, `incrementedNum` and `num` both become `6`.

**Prefix Decrement (`--var`):** The prefix decrement operator decreases the value of the variable by one and returns the new value.

```javascript
let num = 5;
let decrementedNum = --num;

console.log(decrementedNum); // Output: 4
console.log(num); // Output: 4
```

Here, `--num` decreases the value of `num` by one before the assignment. Thus, `decrementedNum` and `num` both become `4`.

Using the prefix form of increment and decrement operators immediately affects the value of the variable and returns the updated value.

## Personal Insights and Summary

- These arithmetic operators can be used with variables, constants, or literal values to perform various mathematical operations in JavaScript. They follow the standard rules of arithmetic, such as the order of operations (parentheses, multiplication/division, and addition/subtraction).
