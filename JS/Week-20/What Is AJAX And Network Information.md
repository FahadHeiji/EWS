[**AJAX** stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ajax-introduction/)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29). [It’s a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29). [AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with a web server behind the scenes](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ajax-introduction/). [This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ajax-introduction/).

[A **Network** in information technology is defined as the connection of at least two computer systems, either by a cable or a wireless connection](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)[5](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/network.htm)[6](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zc6rcdm/revision/1)[7](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/what-is-a-network/). [The simplest network is a combination of two computers connected by a cable](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[7](https://www.ionos.com/digitalguide/server/know-how/what-is-a-network/). [A network is a collection of computers, servers, mainframes, peripherals, or other devices connected to facilitate communication and data sharing](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)[5](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/network.htm)[6](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zc6rcdm/revision/1). [Essentially, it is a system that allows two or more devices to exchange information, resources, and services](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network)[5](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/network.htm)[6](https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/guides/zc6rcdm/revision/1). [You can think of a network like a spider web](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_ajax.asp)[5](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/n/network.htm).

[AJAX, which stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a set of web development techniques that uses various web technologies on the client-side to create asynchronous web applications](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[3](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp). Here are some key points about AJAX:

- [AJAX allows web applications to send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behavior of the existing page](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[3](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp).
- [By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, AJAX allows web pages and, by extension, web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29).
- [AJAX is not a programming language or technology, but rather a programming concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm). [It uses a combination of multiple web-related technologies like HTML, XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, DOM, XML, XSLT, and the XMLHttpRequest object](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm)[4](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ajax/what_is_ajax.htm).
- [The XMLHttpRequest object is used to execute AJAX on web pages, allowing websites to load content onto the screen without refreshing the page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29).
- AJAX is not a new technology, nor is it a new language. [Instead, it is existing technologies used in a new way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29).
- [In practice, modern implementations commonly utilize JSON instead of XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29).
- [Examples of applications using AJAX include Gmail, Google Maps, Youtube, and Facebook tabs](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp)[3](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp).

[In short, AJAX is about loading data in the background and displaying it on the webpage, without reloading the whole page](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp)[3](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_ajax_intro.asp). [It’s a developer’s dream because it allows for a smoother user experience](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp)[1](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/ajax_intro.asp).
