**Synchronous** and **Asynchronous** are two different methods of transmission of data, particularly in computing and telecommunication. Here’s a comparison of the two:

1. **Synchronous**:
    
    - [Synchronous means happening at the same time](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[1](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/).
    - [In the context of data transmission, data is sent in form of blocks or frames](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).
    - [Synchronous communication involves real-time back-and-forth—talking face to face and video chatting are synchronous forms of communication](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[1](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/).
    - [Synchronous transmission is fast, but it’s also costly](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).
    - [Examples: Telephonic conversations, Video conferencing, Online gaming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).
2. **Asynchronous**:
    
    - [Asynchronous means not happening at the same time](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[1](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/).
    - [In the context of data transmission, data is sent in form of bytes or characters](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).
    - [Asynchronous communication involves messages being transmitted back and forth but not through direct interaction and not necessarily at the same time](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[1](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/).
    - [Asynchronous transmission is slower than synchronous transmission, but it’s more economical](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).
    - [Examples: Email, File transfer, Online forms](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).

In summary, the key difference between synchronous and asynchronous is the timing of communication. [In synchronous communication, the communication is real-time, whereas in asynchronous communication, there can be a time lag between the sender and receiver](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[1](https://www.dictionary.com/e/asynchronous-vs-synchronous/)[2](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-synchronous-and-asynchronous-transmission/).
