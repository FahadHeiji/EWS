# Function

## What Is Function?
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions provide better modularity for your application and high degree of code reusing.

## User-Defined vs Built-In
- **User-Defined Functions**: These are the functions that users define themselves to perform a specific task.
- **Built-In Functions**: These are the functions that are pre-defined in a programming language.

## Syntax + Basic Usage
The basic syntax for a function in JavaScript is:
```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
  // code to be executed
}
````

You call or invoke the function by using its name followed by parentheses and passing in any required parameters.

## Example From Real Life

Think of a function as a machine in a factory. The machine takes in some raw material (the input or parameters), performs some operation, and returns a finished product (the output or return value).

## Parameter + Argument

- **Parameter**: A parameter is a named variable passed into a function. They are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses.
- **Argument**: An argument is the actual value that gets passed to the function.

## Practical Example

Here’s a practical example of a function:

```javascript
function sayHello(userName) {
  console.log(`Hi ${userName}`);
}

sayHello("Osama");
sayHello("Sayed");
sayHello("Ali");
```

In this example, `sayHello` is a user-defined function that takes one parameter, `userName`. When we call the function, we pass in a string as an argument, which is then inserted into the string that’s logged to the console.
