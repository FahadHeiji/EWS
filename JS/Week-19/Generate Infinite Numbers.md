In JavaScript, you can generate an infinite sequence of numbers using a generator function. Here’s how you can do it:

```javascript
function* infiniteNumbers() {
  let n = 1;
  while (true) {
    yield n++;
  }
}

let numbers = infiniteNumbers(); // "numbers" is an iterator that produces infinite numbers

console.log(numbers.next().value); // Outputs: 1
console.log(numbers.next().value); // Outputs: 2
console.log(numbers.next().value); // Outputs: 3
// ... and so on ...
```

In this example, `infiniteNumbers` is a generator function that yields an infinite sequence of numbers. Each time its `next` method is called, it yields the next number in the sequence.

However, be careful when working with infinite sequences. If you try to consume an infinite sequence in a context that doesn’t understand its infiniteness (like a `for...of` loop or a spread operator), you’ll create an infinite loop that could crash your program.

Remember, even though the sequence is theoretically infinite, in practice, it’s limited by the maximum number that JavaScript can represent (`Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`), which is `9007199254740991`. After this point, JavaScript’s ability to accurately represent integers breaks down. So while the sequence is “infinite” in theory, it’s not truly infinite in a practical sense. But for most purposes, this is more than enough.
