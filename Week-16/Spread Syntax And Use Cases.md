The spread operator (`...`) allows an iterable (like an array or string) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments or elements are expected.

Here are the key points:

- **Spread with String**: When used with a string, the spread operator expands the string into individual characters.
    
- **Concatenate Arrays**: The spread operator can be used to concatenate or merge arrays.
    
- **Copy Array**: The spread operator can be used to create a shallow copy of an array.
    
- **Push Inside Array**: The spread operator can be used to push elements from one array into another array.
    
- **Use with Math Object**: The spread operator can be used with the `Math` object to apply functions like `Math.max()` to arrays.
    
- **Spread with Objects**: The spread operator can be used to merge objects. If the objects have common properties, the properties of the second object will overwrite those of the first.
